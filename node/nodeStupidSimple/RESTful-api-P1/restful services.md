- client talks with server using HTTP requests 
![[Pasted image 20250517192242.png]]
- on the server we expose a bunch of services that the client can call

- REST is short for Representational State Transfer
- it's basically a set of rules for how to build this http services in the server
- it provides a way to do CRUD operations on resources 

**standard HTTP methods :**
- GET : retrieve a resource
- POST : create a resource
- PUT : update a resource
- DELETE : delete a resource

lets explain this URL Â **http://vidly.com/api/customers**

- this is called the [[endpoint]]
- a client will make a request to this endpoint to talk to the server
- the address can start with http or https that depends on the server requirements 
- vidly.com is the domain name of the server 
- - /api/customers is the resource
