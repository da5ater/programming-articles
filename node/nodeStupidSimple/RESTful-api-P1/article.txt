RESTful services 

- lets cut the crap and get to the point
- RESTful services are a way to expose your data and functionality over HTTP requests 
- we have a dynamic that is important to undetand 
- we have a client and a server

!!!
- the client is the one that makes the request

!!!
- the server is the one that responds to the request
- and on the server we expose a bunch of services that the client can call

but how do the client talks with the server? 
- client talks with server using HTTP requests 
- the server responds to the client using HTTP responses

ok so in our article the client is actually us in a web browser by typing a URL like this :
http://localhost:3000/


and the server is actually our application that is running on port 3000
- in this section of the last article we created a dump server using the http module https://medium.com/@mohamedsocial555/node-modules-stupid-simple-7fd143cc93a2#:~:text=own%20event%20emitter-,http%20module,-is%20used%20for
- we will be recreating it using express framework 


but here are key information about REST services :

- REST is short for Representational State Transfer
- it's basically a set of rules for how to build this http services in the server
- it provides a way to do CRUD operations on resources 

- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete

and standard HTTP methods are :
- GET: used to retrieve data from the server
- POST: used to send data to the server
- PUT: used to update data on the server
- DELETE: used to delete data from the server



our main goal is to create a server that can respond to HTTP requests using express framework
- express is a web framework for node.js that makes it easy to create web applications and APIs
- it is built on top of the http module and provides a lot of features that make it easier to work with HTTP requests and responses


one last thing is 
lets explain this URL Â **http://vidly.com/api/customers**
- this is called the endpoint
- a client will make a request to this endpoint to talk to the server
- the address can start with http or https that depends on the server requirements
- vidly.com is the domain name of the server
- /api/customers is the resource


Main Takeaways:
- RESTful services let clients and servers talk using HTTP.
- REST uses standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Express makes building REST APIs in Node.js simple.
- Endpoints are URLs where clients access server resources.

ok enough talking lets get to the meat of the article
